# ANALYSIS-OF-USED-CARS-IN-INDIA-1996---2019
This analysis delves into the used car market in india from 1996 to 2019, offering insights into trends, pricing patterns and factors that influence vehicles generally, usage, resale etc.
From the analysis, it was observed that the maximum price of cars fluctuates over the years with the highest price recorded in 2017 at $160 and the lowest in 1998 at $3.90 which suggests that cars from recent years tend to have higher prices which could be linked to inflation, release and demand for newer models and advancements in technology.

The Count of manual cars was observed to be significantly higher than automatic transmission car types with a count of 5204 and 2049 respectively which suggests a preference for manual transmission cars to automatic cars in India probably due to cost of automatic cars, limited quantity, occupation or reason for driving, terrain  or more proportion of older folks driving the most cars in the areas mentioned.

Putting into consideration the seater types, cars with 4 seaters have the highest percentage of users with about 34%  and an average price of $20.75 while 8 seater cars have the lowest with 12.22% and an average price of $7.46 and this informs that despite the price of the less seaters (4 seaters) users are still ready to but them which may be linked to luxury, more refined and better conditions when compared with the higher seater vehicles

Furthermore, First ownership cars top the chart with 3012 counts of users which indicates that cars sold as first owner vehicles are the most sought after within this areas. 

Diesel cars also top the chart by fuel type with a count of 3852 entries closely followed by petrol with 3235 entries leaving the other types of fuel types; CNG, LPG and Electric  at the far end.

Recommendations however include the following; 

Automakers should highlight the benefits of automatic cars especially electric and hybrid models as they  often have better efficiency and lower emissions when compared to manual cars thereby reducing the environmental pollution caused by manual cars leading to a cleaner and more friendly environment.  

Just as stated in the observations, mountainous terrains could als0 be one reason why manual cars were better preferred, and with regards to that, automakers should design automatic vehicles that can perform well in challenging terrains or less motorable areas.


Since the 4 seater vehicles are already resonating with users, doubling down on the strength of these vehicles and putting more into marketing them could also drive a more improved market and users for these automakers. Secondly, a survey should be carried out as to the reason why the 8 seater vehicles have lower uses and the feedback gotten be worked on to improve the features of these vehicles in the latest models and make them valuable once again.


First ownership cars are already in high demand but can be made higher by promoting more aggressively, educating car owners and intending car owners the advantages of using first owned cars over the second and other types of owned cars as they are reliable, less complaint and damage to both the cars, the users and the environment as a whole.
